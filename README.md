# Movie-searcher

This is a Front-end project, a Single Page Application (Vue, Vuex and Vue-router). It searches movies from the [TheMovieDatabase API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and shows them **sorted** by popularity or by genre. Clicking on each will make appear a dialog with more details about the movie. The search is **live search**, on input change, also has pagination, and a **cart** where you can send or remove the movies with just a click.
